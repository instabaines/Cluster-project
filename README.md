# Cluster-project
Clustering well log  data
This project is targeted at improving the identification of lithology from well logs using Machine learning. 
The algorithms employed are Processing algorithms such as Minmaxscaler and StandardScaler and Clustring algorithms such as KMeans Clustering, Heirichial Clustering and MiniBatchKmeans algorithms. 
Clustering algorithms are used to cluster the data into different groups. The silhouette score and computing time are used as metrics.
This cluster groups when correlated with depth can give an idea of type of lithology present.
 Computing time and silhouette score are used to select the optimum algorithm.

The code can be run directly from the notebook
